            Hi there! I am John Doe, a passionate and creative web developer
            with a strong focus on front-end development. I enjoy turning
            complex problems into simple, beautiful, and intuitive designs.
          </p>
          <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
            My journey into web development started X years ago when I
            discovered my love for coding. Since then, I have been honing my
            skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various front-end frameworks
            like React.js.
          </p>
          <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
            Apart from coding, I have a keen interest in UI/UX design principles
            and strive to create user-friendly interfaces that provide a
            seamless experience across all devices.
          </p>
          <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
            Currently, I am exploring new technologies to expand my skill set
            and keep up with the ever-evolving landscape of web development.
