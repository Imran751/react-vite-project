## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev` / `yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open `http://localhost:3000` to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build` / `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run serve` / `yarn serve`

Serves the production build locally. Useful for testing the production build before deployment.

### `npm run lint` / `yarn lint`

Runs ESLint to check for linting errors.
